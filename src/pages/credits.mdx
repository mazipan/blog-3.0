# ❤️ Credits

This project wouldn’t have been possible without the incredible work and inspiration from these amazing websites. They laid the foundation and sparked countless ideas. All credit goes to them:

- [nemanjam/nemanjam.github.io ↗️](https://github.com/nemanjam/nemanjam.github.io): For providing a fantastic Astro-based project starter that powers my website. I only added a sprinkle of customization on top of their great foundation.
- [iamtamara.design ↗️](https://www.iamtamara.design/): For inspiring me with beautifully crafted copy.
- [theodorusclarence.com ↗️](https://theodorusclarence.com/): For influencing the page structure and features, like the guest book page, attribution page, footer design, and many others.
- [jestsee.com ↗️](https://www.jestsee.com/): Another good example of portofolio page, much inspired this website.
- [nextready.dev ↗️](https://nextready.dev/): For the sleek floating, glassy header design that inspired my website’s header.

And many more, see in [friends ↗️](/friends).

Thank you for sharing your creativity and setting the bar so high! 🌟

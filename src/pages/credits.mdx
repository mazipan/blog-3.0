# ❤️ Credits

I can not deliver this project without these amazing websites. The starter and the inspirations. All credits goes to them.

- [nemanjam/nemanjam.github.io ↗️](https://github.com/nemanjam/nemanjam.github.io), for creating project starter for this website.
- [www.iamtamara.design ↗️](https://www.iamtamara.design/), for a neat copy in his website.
- [theodorusclarence.com ↗️](https://theodorusclarence.com/), for the page structure and feature inspirations, such as the guest book page, the attribution page, the footer design, the table of contents inside the post detail page and many more.
- [nextready.dev ↗️](https://nextready.dev/), for a floating and glassy header inspiration.

Welcome to my coding blog. Here, I will share my coding experiments and thoughts on React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Astro, Python, DevOps, and more. Feel free to read, explore, and comment. Or, if you are feeling overwhelmed by coding, you can take a break and enjoy some random landscape photos from the articles. Maybe in the future, we will create a separate gallery for them. We will see.

              A frontend engineer, now work in Tokopedia as Principal Engineer Web Platform.
              I already start my software engineering careers since 2013.
              Before joining Tokopedia, I work on several companies such as Bizzy Indonesia, Blibli.com and SML Technologies.
              I spent the last 6 years to work on online commerce industry.

              I used to build the web using various JavaScript framework, I am not fanatic with any frontend frameworks out there.
              I have professional experience with some of popular JavaScript frameworks like React.js, Svelte, Vue.js and AngularJS in the early version.
              I prefer to writing the unit test rather than should to test my code manually.
              I have experience in writing many custom configuration for the build tools for the front end codebase.
              You just name it, webpack, rollup, or even the native Node.js custom script, I can work with it (<i>or at least I can learn it if I don't know it yet</i>).

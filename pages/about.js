            <p>
              A frontend engineer, now work in Tokopedia as Principal Engineer Web Platform.
              I already start my software engineering careers since 2013.
              Before joining Tokopedia, I work on several companies such as Bizzy Indonesia, Blibli.com and SML Technologies.

              I used to build the web using various JavaScript framework, or I can say that I am not fanatic with any frameworks out there.
              I have experience in writing many custom configuration for the build tools for the front end codebase. You just name it, webpack, rollup, or any other build tools, I can work with it (<i>or at least I can learn it easily if I don't know it yet</i>).
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              Outside my job as a full time employee, I also build a close connection with many programmer communities in Indonesia to give back my knowledge and experience in the web development to the other engineers.
